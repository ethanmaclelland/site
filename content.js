            "There's something deeply satisfying about taking apart complex problems and putting them back together in ways that just work, and work well. My UConn mechanical engineering background gives me the technical foundation, but my real strength comes from seeing opportunities where others see obstacles.",
            
            "My entrepreneurial journey started early - I was buying broken iPods, fixing them up, and flipping them for profit on my family room floor. But real estate captured my attention during my sophomore year at UConn when my Zillow search filters switched from \"For Rent\" to \"For Sale.\" That's how I discovered The Vinton, a Victorian Tudor that became my first investment property and the foundation of MAC Development Co.",
            
            "I've dabbled in everything from iOS apps to e-commerce stores to landscaping businesses, and now I run MAC Development Co., specializing in value-add real estate investments using the BRRR strategy. I've also gained valuable field engineering experience managing critical MBTA infrastructure projects, which taught me invaluable lessons about working under pressure and coordinating complex operations.",
